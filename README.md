# RoboRex Security System


## Description 
This Python program utilizes essential programming principles, including control flow statements and data structures, to develop a straightforward security system. The system engages with users by requesting their names and allows them to add or remove themselves from the security database.


## Language and Utilities Used
- Python 3.10.11
- Thonny 4.1.3


## Environments Used
- Windows 11


## Notes
A while loop was used for basic user validation. Better methods may exist, so further exploration is planned for future implementation.
