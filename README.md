# Ridiculous Security System


# Description 
This Python project leverages logical expressions, if/elif/else statements, and data structures (specifically, a list) to create an entertaining security robot. The robot interacts with users, prompting them for their names and granting the ability to add or remove themselves from the security system.

<h2>Language and Utilities Used</h2>

- Python 3.10.11
- Thonny 4.1.3

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- Windows 11
